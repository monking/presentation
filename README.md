TL;DR: keyboard control only, for now

I'd considered enabling the mouse to advance content with the mousewheel, and move the next and previous slides by clicking on the right and left sides, but I though it wouuld be more valuable to leave the mouse free to interact with the slides (scrolling _and_ clicking).

I'd also originally made it so that advancing the content to the end of a slide wouuld automatically go to the next slide. This would be nice for a clicker or some simple input. But for me, it's too easy to spam the arrow key as I'm racing to the end of a slide, and shoot off to the next slide unintentionally. This way I don't have to worry about ditching a slide prematurely.

The slides were very effective as a plan and visual aid, letting me confidently say that some early questions could be addressed in a future slide. And being able to zip backward and forward in revealing lists of content allowed me to highlight certain concepts. I also used my mouse a bunch to select text. Unfortunately, my dictionary extension in chrome was kicking in when I'd double-click a word.

I presented from my Chromebook, and I believe it worked very well. I'll look at the video later when Rajesh shares it.
